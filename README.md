# **BLACKJACK GAME**

In Blackjack, everyone plays against the dealer (the house). Your goal is to draw cards with a value as close to 21 as possible without going over. A hand that goes over 21 is a bust or break . 
The players at a blackjack table do not play against each other, they play against the dealer.
